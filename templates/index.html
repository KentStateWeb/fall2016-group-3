        <h2>What We Strive For?</h2>
        <p class="goals">Our goal is to make pet owners and their pets as comfortable as possible during your
          veterinarian visit. Pets First strives to provide pets with <strong>decreased wait time</strong>, and
          always make <strong>client service a priority</strong>. Additionally, all of the Veterinarians at Pets First
          enjoy rewarding our patients with as much <strong>T.L.C.</strong> as possible. We are very flexible and will do anything we can
          to make the visit less stressful for your loved pets - dogs, cats and more. Dr. Benjamin chooses his veterinary team members
          very carefully and specifically looks for individuals that can help him achieve these goals.</p>
          <p class="goals2">At our clinic, we <strong>always welcome new clients and patients</strong> to our full service veterinary practice
            in Kent, OH.</p>
